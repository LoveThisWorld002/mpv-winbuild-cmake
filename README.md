# CMake-based MinGW-w64 Cross Toolchain

This thing’s primary use is to build Windows binaries of mpv.

Alternatively, you can download the builds from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/).

## Prerequisites

 -  You should also install Ninja and use CMake’s Ninja build file generator.
    It’s not only much faster than GNU Make, but also far less error-prone,
    which is important for this project because CMake’s ExternalProject module
    tends to generate makefiles which confuse GNU Make’s jobserver thingy.

 -  As a build environment, any modern Linux distribution *should* work.

-   Compiling on Cygwin / MSYS2 is supported, but it tends to be slower
    than compiling on Linux.

## Setup Build Environment
### Manjaro / Arch Linux

These packages need to be installed first before compiling mpv:

    pacman -S git gyp mercurial subversion ninja cmake meson ragel yasm nasm asciidoc enca gperf unzip p7zip gcc-multilib clang python-pip curl lib32-glib2

    pip3 install rst2pdf mako jsonschema

### Ubuntu Linux / WSL (Windows 10)

    apt-get install build-essential checkinstall bison flex gettext git mercurial subversion ninja-build gyp cmake yasm nasm automake pkgconf libtool libtool-bin gcc-multilib g++-multilib clang libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev libgcrypt-dev gperf ragel texinfo autopoint re2c asciidoc python3-pip docbook2x unzip p7zip-full curl

    pip3 install rst2pdf meson mako jsonschema

**Note:**

* Use [apt-fast](https://github.com/ilikenwf/apt-fast) if apt-get is too slow.
* It is advised to use bash over dash. Set `sudo ln -sf /bin/bash /bin/sh`. Revert back by `sudo ln -sf /bin/dash /bin/sh`.
* On WSL platform, compiling 32bit requires qemu. Refer to [this](https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/2468#issuecomment-374904520).
* To update package installed by pip, run `pip3 install <package> --upgrade`.

### Cygwin

Download Cygwin installer and run:

    setup-x86_64.exe -R "C:\cygwin64" -q --packages="bash,binutils,bzip2,cygwin,gcc-core,gcc-g++,cygwin32-gcc-core,cygwin32-gcc-g++,gzip,m4,pkgconf,make,unzip,zip,diffutils,wget,git,patch,cmake,gperf,yasm,enca,asciidoc,bison,flex,gettext-devel,mercurial,python-devel,python-docutils,docbook2X,texinfo,libmpfr-devel,libgmp-devel,libmpc-devel,libtool,autoconf2.5,automake,automake1.9,libxml2-devel,libxslt-devel,meson,libunistring5"

Additionally, some packages, `re2c`, `ninja`, `ragel`, `gyp`, `rst2pdf`, `nasm` need to be [installed manually](https://gist.github.com/shinchiro/705b0afcc7b6c0accffba1bedb067abf).

### MSYS2

Install MSYS2 and run it via `MSYS2 MSYS` shortcut.
Don't use `MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit` or `MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit` shortcuts, that's important!

These packages need to be installed first before compiling mpv:

    pacman -S base-devel cmake gcc yasm nasm git mercurial subversion gyp tar gmp-devel mpc-devel mpfr-devel python zlib-devel unzip zip p7zip meson libunistring5

Don't install anything from the `mingw32` and `mingw64` repositories,
it's better to completely disable them in `/etc/pacman.conf` just to be safe.

Additionally, some packages, `re2c`, `ninja`, `ragel`, `libjpeg`, `rst2pdf`, `jinja2` need to be [installed manually](https://gist.github.com/shinchiro/705b0afcc7b6c0accffba1bedb067abf).


## Compiling with GCC (First Time)

To set up the build environment, create a directory to store build files in:

    mkdir build64
    cd build64

Once you’ve changed into that directory, run CMake, e.g.

    cmake -DTARGET_ARCH=x86_64-w64-mingw32 -G Ninja ..

add `-DGCC_ARCH=x86-64-v3` to command-line if you want to compile gcc with new `x86-64-v3` instructions. Other value like `native`, `znver3` should work too in theory.

or for 32bit:

    cmake -DTARGET_ARCH=i686-w64-mingw32 -G Ninja ..

First, you need to build toolchain. By default, it will be installed in `install` folder. This take ~20 minutes on my 4-core machine.

    ninja gcc

After it done, you're ready to build mpv and all its dependencies:

    ninja mpv

This will take a while (about ~10 minutes on my machine).

On **WSL2**, you might see it stuck with 100% disk usage and never finished. To fix it, build package `shaderc`, `spirv-cross` and `harfbuzz` separately first before `mpv`.

The final `build64` folder's size will be around ~3GB.

## Building Software (Second Time)

To build mpv for a second time:

    ninja update

After that, build mpv as usual:

    ninja mpv

This will also build all packages that `mpv` depends on.

## Compiling with Clang

Supported target architecture (`TARGET_ARCH`) with clang is: `x86_64-w64-mingw32` , `i686-w64-mingw32` , `aarch64-w64-mingw32` and `armv7-w64-mingw32`. The `aarch64` and `armv7` are untested.

Example:

    cmake -G Ninja -Bbuild_x86_64 -Hmpv-winbuild-cmake -DTARGET_ARCH=x86_64-w64-mingw32 -DCOMPILER_TOOLCHAIN=clang -DALWAYS_REMOVE_BUILDFILES=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=clang_root -DSINGLE_SOURCE_LOCATION=src_packages -DRUSTUP_LOCATION=install_rustup

The cmake command will create `clang_root` as clang sysroot while `build_x86_64` as build directory to compiling packages.

    cd build_x86_64
    ninja llvm # build LLVM (take 2 hours+)
    ninja llvm-clang # build Clang on specified target

If you want add another target (ex. `i686-w64-mingw32`), change `TARGET_ARCH` and build folder and just run:

    ninja llvm-clang

If you've changed `GCC_ARCH` optimization, you need to run:

    ninja rebuild_cache

to update flags which will pass on gcc, g++ and etc. `build_x86_64` is build folder you've created.

## Available Commands

| Commands                   | Description |
| -------------------------- | ----------- |
| ninja package              | compile a package |
| ninja clean                | remove all stamp files in all packages. |
| ninja download             | Download all packages' sources at once without compiling. |
| ninja update               | Update all git repos. When a package pulls new changes, all of its stamp files will be deleted and will be forced rebuild. If there is no change, it will not remove the stamp files and no rebuild occur. Use this instead of `ninja clean` if you don't want to rebuild everything in the next run. |
| ninja package-fullclean    | Remove all stamp files of a package. |
| ninja package-liteclean    | Remove build, clean stamp files only. This will skip re-configure in the next running `ninja package` (after the first compile). Updating repo or patching need to do manually. Ideally, all `DEPENDS` targets in `package.cmake` should be temporarily commented or deleted. Might be useful in some cases. |
| ninja package-removebuild  | Remove 'build' directory of a package. |
| ninja package-removeprefix | Remove 'prefix' directory. |
| ninja package-force-update | Update a package. Only git repo will be updated. |

`package` is package's name found in `packages` folder.
